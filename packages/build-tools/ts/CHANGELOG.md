This is much better experience than having to deal with generated .gen.cjs/mjs files that we then have to commit along with the source code.

  Here is an [example](https://github.com/zaripych/repka/blob/e804d34feba9e4205ffd4e9f791bee7e4dc96ac2/packages/build-tools/ts/src/bin/eslint.ts#L1) of a source file that this [bin](https://github.com/zaripych/repka/blob/e804d34feba9e4205ffd4e9f791bee7e4dc96ac2/packages/build-tools/ts/package.json#L33) entry points to from "package.json".
